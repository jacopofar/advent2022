# Advent of code 2022

This repository contains my solution to the Advent of Code 2022, in Python.

My goal this year is to screen record the process with a live comment (in Italian with English subtitles. Code will be commented in English as usual).

This is the YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFcn89zoMpRqt0RPtNKpdbg

In the subtitles folder you can fine the subtitles, they are generated with Whisper but manually checked and corrected.
